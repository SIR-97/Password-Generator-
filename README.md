# Password-Generator-

For this challenge I utilised skills learnt for JavaScript, in order to create an application which one can use to generate a random password. I have included the following requirments:

My application generates a password when the button is clicked.

my application presents a series of prompts for the users password criteria: 
- Length of password
- At least 10 characters but no more than 64.
- Character types: Lowercase, Uppercase, Numeric, Special characters ($@%&*, etc.)

my application validates for each input and at least one character type can be selected.

Once all prompts are answered, a password can be generated and is displayed.
